# Quantum_computing
Here, I collect some of the codes that I write during my learning of quantum computing.

Currently, I am practicing writing codes with the use of Qulacs,

[Qulacs: a fast and versatile quantum circuit simulator for research purpose](https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.13524),

and learning the coding by reading [Quantum Native Dojo](https://dojo.qulacs.org/ja/latest/index.html).
